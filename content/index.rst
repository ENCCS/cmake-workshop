CMake
=====

CMake is a language-agnostic, cross-platform build tool and is nowadays the *de
facto* standard,  with large projects using it to reliably build, test, and
deploy their codebases. You will learn how to:

- Write a CMake build system for C, C++, and Fortran projects producing
  libraries and/or executables.
- Run tests for your code with CTest.
- Ensure your build system will work on different platforms.
- Detect and use external dependencies in your project.
- Safely and effectively build mixed-language projects (Python+C/C++,
  Python+Fortran, Fortran+C/C++)
